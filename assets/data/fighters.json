While bred to hunt lions, our precious Maika would rather chase snowflakes and run from her own jingle bells. A bouncing bundle of holiday joy with the heart of a cautious elf - she might need some convincing that the obstacle course isn't hiding the abominable snowman!",

Powering through like a Christmas train that forgot its brakes. Just don't expect him to read the course map - navigation isn't on his list of Christmas miracles!",
